## NodeJS Boilerplate - ExpressJS

This boilerplate can be used for easy prototyping of new projects.

1. Install with `npm install`
2. Start server with `nodemon server`
3. Query the GET with `curl http://localhost:3001/`
4. Query the POST with `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "vivek"}'`

A Postman collection with these requests are also included in the repo.
